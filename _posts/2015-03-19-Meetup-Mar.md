**MAIN PRESENTATION**  
Digital Effin Strategy _|  Presentation by [Mariano Crivello](https://twitter.com/MarianoCrivello)_  

We have been called architects, developers, designers, guru's, nerds, The IT gal or guy, code monkey, marketing dude, seo wiz and more...   but who we are...  at our core...  is a digital strategist.

We are people who strategize the use of technology to effect change. And we are damn good at it.  

This is your personally catered pep rally.

**THUNDER TALK**  
One Size fits all | Presentation by [Michael Stewart](https://twitter.com/MediaDoneRight.com).

Come learn how to utilize open source tools to build world-class websites of all sizes. Do you mainly work on promotional Micro sites? Maybe you also build small websites for mom-and-pop type businesses on a tight budget? Or maybe you work for an agency creating complex enterprise sites with multilingual, multi-departmental content workflows, etc. This talk will focus on how to retool your craft with a single set of open source tools that works across platforms to meet the needs of most websites. In recent years there's been a plethora of open source technologies to either simplify and/or automate the build-out of web and applications. Everything in the development stack, including the tools and the OS can now be virtualized, automated, simplified, tested, and deployed, using a huge stack of tools that need to work together. I'll hit on some of the tools I use as well as some I've recently learned about this year at various talks. I'll primarily focus on how to use an open/free desktop utilizing only open source tools and a technology stack to build the modern standards based websites.

> [About Michael Stewart](https://twitter.com/MediaDoneRight)  
> A long time open source evangelist, community organizer, and resident of Long Beach. Started his career in Enterprise  I.T. implementing projects such as: Customer Relationship Management, Engineering Document Management, and  ERP System; on an early Windows NT / Oracle configuration. His knowledge of Microsoft technologies, ERP and manufacturing led him to employers focused on Warehouse Management Systems, Time & Attendance, and Management Execution Systems. The latter projects utilized early Microsoft web technologies which eventually led him to consulting building websites and web based applications. Ultimately, licensing independence for his clients plus the discovery of the principles behind free software, led him to Drupal as a veritable swiss-army-knife for the web, and free software in general.

### ABOUT  
Our meetups are FREE and everyone is welcome.  Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imaginations, to build   skill-sets, network, and grow  community!  So if you work or have interest in Web or Application Development, or just like talking geek, _add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!_

We have a preference towards open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we will have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Below are some potential topics for future meetups, or at least conversation starters when we get together:
