The Long Beach [Web & App dev Professionals (WAPRO)](http://wapro.lbtech.org) group meets monthly to showcase our cool tech projects, share best practices, network with each other, help newcomers, and the values of open source software (F/OSS).  We strive to do this in a professional, relaxed, respectful, and open venue for _all people_ in our community.  **Website:** http://wapro.lbtech.org/about

### TALKS THIS MONTH   
* Aaron Pederson - Let's talk about SASS  
* Mariano Crivello - Digital Effin Strategy  

Our kickoff meeting was January at [WE Labs](http://welabs.us).  We had presentations and sharing from people that discussed their work utilizing **Drupal, Jekyll, Node.js, Yeoman, Varnish, PHP, CME, and Bootstrap**, on projects for **SpaceX.com, Riot Games League of Legends, X Prize, and others**. It was a great way to start 2015, but, we're just getting started in Long Beach!  **What I know from experience:** Some of my best projects and connections have come through my involvement in community events.  Don't miss out!

This Month we change venue to [Gunn-Jerkins](http://gunnjerkins.com) (near LGB airport).  We'll be back to WE Labs soon enough, but this month is an opportunity to visit one of best creative agency's in Long Beach while we wow you with at least two more great talks, and everything the community brings to share.

**MAIN PRESENTATION  **
Let's talk about SASS _||  Presentation by [Aaron Pedersen](http://twitter.com/aaronpedersen)_  

The "coding" concepts behind [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) leave many front-end developer resistant to the language and process. In this talk, Aaron will cover the basic concepts and show you how easy it is to get up and running with SASS and how to integrate it into your development workflow. As an example, we'll be checking out the [lbtech.github.io](https://github.com/lbtech/lbtech.github.io) repository, making some modifications and pushing those changes to github. The goal of this talk is to show you how the language can help speed up development and bring more organization and beauty (yes code can be pretty) to your css code base.

### ABOUT  
Our meetups are FREE and everyone is welcome.  Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imaginations, to build   skill-sets, network, and grow  community!  So if you work or have interest in Web or Application Development, or just like talking geek, _add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!_

We have a preference towards open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we will have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.
