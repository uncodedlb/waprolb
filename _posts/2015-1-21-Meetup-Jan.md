**Meetup Date: {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}**  

The Long Beach __Web & App dev Professionals (WAPRO)__ group meets monthly to showcase our cool tech projects, share best practices, network with each other, help newcomers, and the values of open source software (F/OSS).  We strive to do this in a professional, relaxed, respectful, and open venue for _all people_ in our community.

### TALKS THIS MONTH

* Frank Anderson - How to not use Drupal + custom PHP = Highly available, Highly customizable, and Fast!
* Chris Charlton - Yeoman (Yo + Grunt + Bower = fast!)


>  MAIN PRESENTATION  
>  How to not use Drupal ||  Presentation by [Frank Anderson](http://twitter.com/frobdfas  

>  [{{ Drupal }}](http://drupal.org) does many things really well, however, it has real-world limitations. This is a talk on using headless Drupal without a REST service or fancy new JS tech. In other words, this is not the typical Headless Drupal Talk thats made the rounds in the last year. Come learn how Frank and the  [KWALL team](http://www.kwallcompany.com) utilized Drupal for what it does well (complex content workflows, roles, user access permissions, etc.) and then coupled it with a custom headless solution in order to create website less-characteristic of Drupal: _highly available, highly customizable, and an extremely fast front-end._ This was accomplished by replacing the user facing Drupal front-end with a custom [{{ PHP }}](http://php.net) website which displays content that is managed with Drupal.

### ABOUT
Our meetups are FREE and everyone is welcome.  Our goal, in essence, is to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imaginations, to build   skill-sets, network, and grow  community!  So if you work or have interest in Web or Application Development, or just like talking geek, _add our meetup to your calendar now and join us!_

We have a preference towards open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we will have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.
